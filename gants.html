"This project aims to create a model archive for the storage and circulation of material evidence concerning the printing industry in late Tudor and early Stuart London."  Specifically, the site meticulously catalogues the main paper groups used by Stansby in his production of Johnson folios.  The watermarks are represented by small thumbnail images that link out to high-resolution TIFFs; the watermark images and measurments are accompanied by a description of the paper ( dimensions, chainlines and wirelines).  each distinct type of paper identified is cross-referenced against all of the works that contain that paper type; a full bibliographic description is given for each of these works.  

Although the site itself contains little explanation of scope or methodology, it includes a link to a paper entitled "Pictures for the Page: Techniques in Watermark Reproduction, Enhancement and Analysis," delivered by Gants to the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia in April 1994. In this paper, Gants provides the rationale for his work and describes his methods.  
Gants depicts the bibliographical study of watermarks as a field still in its early stages of evolution.  He claims that watermarks tend to be used as "illustrative rather than analytical evidence", perhaps because scholars are daunted by the technical issues involved in serious watermark study.  

Gants' method resembles that of Allison -- he creates Dylux prints of the watermarks, then scans them on a flatbed scanner and uses a Unix application called XV to manipulate and enhance the images, resulting in reproductions that approach the quality of beta-radiographs , but with a much more flexible and adaptable method.
