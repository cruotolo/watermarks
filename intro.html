<p>
I began this project in order to explore the possibilities of using a digital 
camera to capture, preserve, compare, and disseminate watermarks.  My ultimate goal was to develop a method 
for using the digital camera that would serve as a useful supplement to the methods 
currently in use -- primarily tracing, photoreactive paper (Dylux) printing, and beta-radiography.  
I eventually devised a method that, while not without some severe limitations, produced some promising results 
that might well serve as a point of departure for further research. I am hopeful that, as digital 
technologies 
continue to evolve in the future, some of the difficulties I encountered over the course of this project can
be overcome, and digital photography will become a more viable alternative to traditional methods of watermark study.</p>


<p>The methodology section of the site describes my raw materials and my rationale for choosing 
them, and the equipment and techniques 
used to capture, store, process and enhance the watermark images.  I've tried to describe the processing steps 
in as much detail as possible, 
so that anyone undertaking a similar project in the future can recreate my results or use them as a
point of departure or 
comparison.  This section also includes an overall evaluation of the method, its advantages and disadvantages, 
and possible future modifications.  In particular, I've looked closely at how the digital camera method stacks
up against the work that many scholars are currently doing with scanning Dylux prints. 
</p>

<p>The image samples included in this project are not intended to provide a comprehensive study of the paper 
of any one particular codex.  Rather, they provide a broad overview of the camera's efficacy on different 
types of paper and different book formats.  I've provided images from folio, quarto, and octavo volumes, as well 
as a number of unbound leaves.  In both the methodology section and the brief introduction to each text,
I've tried to address the technical challenges associated with each format, 
and the methodological adjustments necessitated by each one.  

</p>

<p>A digitally reproduced watermark is of potential value not only to the scholar who created it, but to 
thousands of other scholars around the world who can access it through the Internet.  Digital watermark archives
promise to allow researchers to compare papers housed thousands of miles apart simultaneously on their computer
screens.  They raise the possibility of ever-expanding, constantly updated collections that can be accessed 
at any time, at trivial expense to the scholar.  Because I find these possibilities to be the most exciting 
aspect  of this research, I've included an archives section that 
contains descriptions of and links to three prominent online watermark 
archives.  Although the images in these collections were scanned with different methods from mine, they provide
interesting models for the scholarly exchange of watermark images and other bibliographical data relating to the study
of paper.
</p>

<p>I look forward to comments, questions, and suggestions regarding this project or any of the work that went 
into it.
