<h3>The Thomas L. Gravell Watermark Archive</h3>

<p>This site is based upon the work of Thomas L. Gravell, a former Dupont employee turned 
bibliographer who developed the Dylux method of capturing watermarks in the 1970s. His 
collection of original Dylux prints and slides includes over 7,000 items and is currently 
housed in Special Collections at the University of Delaware Library.   In 1995, Gravell 
collaborated with the Center for Applied Technologies in the Humanities (CATH) at Virginia 
Tech to create a searchable online electronic database of his  watermarks collection.  

<p>Gravell's slides were scanned with a slide scanner at a fairly low resolution (109 dpi) 
and digitally enhanced through Adobe Photoshop.  The images, along with Gravell's identifying 
notations, have been incorporated into a FileMakerPro database that is dynamically accessible 
through the web.  Users of the site can browse abbreviated records with thumbnail images, or 
retrieve the full-sized images in a separate window.  The browse function is particularly helpful, as
users can instantly call up every example of a particular design in the entire collection, using pull-down
menus that use a standardized terminology.

<p>According to the maintainers of the site, there are plans to incorporate all 
7,000+images from the Gravell collection, and then expand the database to include 
donated watermarks generated with Dylux as well as through other methods.   For example, 
they plan to incorporate 45,000 unpublished tracings collected by Charles-Moïse Briquet 
and currently housed at the Bibliothèque publique et universitaire in Geneva.  
However, despite these ambitions, only 343 images appear to be included in the searchable FileMaker database 
at this time, and, with two exceptions, all of these papers date from the late 17th century or earlier.

<h3>A Digital Catalogue of Watermarks and Type Ornaments Used by William Stansby in the Printing of <i>The Workes of Beniamin Jonson</i> (London: 1616)</h3>

<p>As David Gants describes it on the introductory page of this site, this project 
"aims to create a model archive for the storage and circulation of material 
evidence concerning the printing industry in late Tudor and early Stuart London."  Specifically, 
the site meticulously catalogues the main paper groups used by Stansby in his production of Johnson 
folios.  The watermarks are represented by small thumbnail images that link out to high-resolution 
TIFFs; the watermark images and measurements are accompanied by a thorough description of the paper, 
including measurements of chainlines and wirelines.
Each type of paper identified is cross-referenced against all of the 
works that contain that paper type; Gants provides a
bibliographic description for each of these works.  

<p>Although the site itself contains little explanation of scope or methodology, it includes a link to a 
paper entitled "Pictures for the Page: Techniques in Watermark Reproduction, Enhancement and Analysis," 
delivered by Gants to the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia in April 1994. 
According to this paper, Gants developed his digitizing techniques not to build a 
web-accessible archive per se (it's worth remembering that
the Internet was still in its infancy at the time of this writing).
Rather, Gants wanted to explore the ability of digital technologies to improve upon the results obtained by 
the "traditional" Dylux method of watermark capture.
He depicts the bibliographical study of watermarks as a field still in its early stages of evolution,
claiming that watermarks tend to be used as "illustrative rather than analytical evidence", perhaps because 
scholars are daunted by the technical issues involved in their study.  He proposes his method as relatively simple and
high-quality alternative to standard methods.  Gants goes on to describe this method:
he creates Dylux prints of the watermarks, then scans them on 
a flatbed scanner and uses a Unix application called XV to manipulate and enhance the images, resulting in 
reproductions that approach the quality of beta-radiographs, but are much more easily obtained.

<h3>Archive of Papers and Watermarks in Greek Manuscripts</h3>
<a href="http://www.bates.edu/Faculty/wmarchive/" target="_blank">http://www.bates.edu/Faculty/wmarchive/</a>

<p>This archive, which dates back to 1994, is largely the work of Robert W. 
Allison, Professor of Religion at Bates College.  It consists of a searchable archive 
of watermark images, categorized according to a standard terminology, as well as an
integrated

database of paper descriptions and a bibliography of materials related to 
watermarks in Greek manuscripts.  The database provides particularly sophisticated search parameters: for
example, one can search for a manuscript by its repository, its codex format, its physical dimensions, its
watermark or chainline patterning, or the name of a particular scriptorium or scribe attributed to it.


<p>The initial set of digital watermarks that form the bulk of this collection 
were created from Greek manuscripts 
at the Philotheou Monastery.  The capture method closely resembles that of Gants' Johnson project: 
scanning technicians first captured the watermarks as Dylux prints, 
then scanned them as red-channel TIFFs to maximize the contrast between yellow 
and blue of the Dylux print.  The images then went through a series of 
automatic and manual enhancements before being 
saved as highly-compressed JPEG images.  

<p>The most unique feature of this site is its interactivity.  The watermark 
database includes a mechanism for accepting submissions of digital watermarks, 
providing detailed instructions for creating a Dylux print or a hand-tracing 
and then converting that reproduction to an image file that is consistent 
with the specifications of the archive. Paper descriptions and bibliographical 
resources may also be contributed through interactive forms on the website.   

<p>Professor Allison gives a thorough history of this project, which 
was driven by the need for a comprehensive, readily-accessible reference to
Greek manuscript papers, in light of the largely Western European focus of most of the work done
on paper.  Allison also notes that his online database has some distinct advantages over traditional
printed watermark catalogs, as the images in his database can readily be exchanged, enhanced, compared, 
indexed, searched, and analyzed by scholars anywhere in the world.
