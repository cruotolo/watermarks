<p>Analyzing watermarks in an octavo is always extremely difficult, because much of the mark is
frequently lost when pages are trimmed.  Despite the very fragmentary nature of the evidence, the octavo
is somewhat easier to manipulate under the digital camera than the quarto, because the marks appear at
the edges of each page and not in the spine fold.  The marks in this book consist of pieces of the initials I and S;
the only variant is the odd three-initial mark found on the last two images.
