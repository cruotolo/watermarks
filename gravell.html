This site is based upon the work of Thomas L. Gravell, a former Dupont employee turned bibliographer who developed the Dylux method of capturing watermarks in the 1970s. His collection of original Dylux prints and slides includes over 7,000 items and is currently housed in Special Collections and the University of Delaware Library.   In 1995, Gravell collaborated with the Center for Applied Technologies in the Humanities (CATH) at Virginia Tech to create a searchable online electronic database of Gravell's watermarks.  

Gravell's slides were scanned with a slide scanner at a fairly low resolution (109 dpi) and digitally enhanced through Adobe Photoshop.  The images, along with Gravell's identifying notations, have been incorporated into a FileMakerPro database that is dynamically accessible through the web.  Users of the site can browse abbreviated records with thumbnail images, or retrieve the full-sized images in a separate window.  

The site plans to incorporate all 7,000+images from teh Gravell collection, and then expand the database to include donated watermarks generated with Dylux as well as other methods; for example, they plan to incorporate 45,000 unpublished tracings collected by Charles-Moïse Briquet and currently housed at the Bibliothèque publique et universitaire in Geneva.  However, only 343 images appear to be included in the searchable FileMaker database at this time, and, with two exceptions, all of these papers date from the late 17th century or earlier.
