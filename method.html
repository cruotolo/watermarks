<h3><font color="#000080">Methods for Watermark Capture and Analysis</font></h3>

<p>My print materials for this project included four editions of Alexander 
Pope, printed in London between 1717 and 1734.  To get a sense of the 
difficulties involved in recreating watermarks in different print formats, 
I used two folios, a quarto, and an
octavo.  I didn't attempt to capture every watermark in these volumes. In 
the folios, I tried to capture the  variety of marks throughout each book, 
focusing primarily on those that were clearest and most intact.  In the 
quarto and octavo, I was particularly interested in marks that had been 
split onto separate leaves, to see if the whole could be reconstructed 
from the digital pieces.  I was also 
fortunate to have access to some unbound leaves, thanks to Terry Belanger 
of the Book Arts Press.  These unbound leaves were particularly valuable 
because they were intact, and there was little or no printing on them to 
obscure the watermark; they were in this sense an "ideal" test case for 
the digital camera capture method.  

<p>To create the digital images, I used a mounted Kontron ProgRes 3012 
Ultra High Resolution Digital Color Camera, running on a Macintosh 
workstation.  Because the books I was photographing were rare and in 
some cases fragile, I used wooden book cradles to support them under 
the camera and a combination of foam wedges and lucite page holders to 
position and hold them open.  The limits of this delicate operation, 
especially for books that were tightly bound, led to the first of several 
methodological compromises: instead of shooting each leaf from the mold 
side, in a uniform orientation, as I had intended, I shot whichever angle 
I could most easily maneuver under the camera, rotating and flipping the 
images at a later stage of processing when necessary.  

<p>To get the watermark to register in the digital photograph, I needed to 
illuminate each leaf from beneath while shooting.  I used a thin, flexible 
fiber-optic light paddle manufactured by a company called 
<a href="bigconnect.com">NoUVIR Research</a>, slipping the paddle underneath 
the leaf just before shooting. I also laid a transparent millimeter rule 
over each leaf before shooting; since the images have been cropped and 
resized during processing, the rule provides a mechanism for rescaling 
each mark to its original dimensions.  I've included physical measurements 
of each watermark along with the images.

<p>When working with the smaller formats, I photographed the entire leaf 
whenever possible, but on the larger folios and unbound leaves I chose to 
focus in on the watermark rather than zooming out to capture the edges of 
the paper.  Each image was shot as a 600 dpi TIFF; the initial capture took 
several minutes for each image, and file size was frequently in excess of 
50MB.  I shipped the finished TIFFs from the Mac workstation to the Etext 
Center's Unix server, where I used a tool called ImageMagick to batch 
process the TIFFs into JPEGs at 50% compression.  The TIFFS were then 
archived to CD-ROMs and cleared off the server; all further manipulation 
and analysis involved the JPEG copies only. 

<p>I opened each JPEG in Adobe Photoshop and saved a copy, slightly reduced 
in dimensions but otherwise unaltered, to serve as the "full view" image.  
Returning to the full-sized image, I cropped out the watermark to create 
the "cropped detail".  When necessary, I flipped the image around to what 
I determined to be the mold side view, and rotated it to a uniform 
orientation (i.e. what I determined to be "right-side up"); I then 
ran Photoshop's "Auto Levels" command, which maximizes color contrast, 
to create a second version of the cropped image.  The "Invert" command 
produces the inverted image; I've included this version because sometimes, 
particularly with highly detailed watermarks, the image registers more 
clearly as a dark outline on a light background than as the reverse.  
Finally, I experimented with a variety of manual techniques for masking 
out the type on the leaf, resulting in the "ink masked" version of the 
image.  In most cases, I've included all four images, leaving it up to 
the viewer to determine which is easiest to compare and interpret.

<h3><font color="#000080">Preliminary Evaluation of the Method</font></h3>

<p>Because I deliberately used a wide variety of papers to generate my
sample images, my results ranged from extremely good to extremely poor.
Under ideal conditions (a prominent watermark on an unbound leaf,
unobscured by text) the digital images resulting from this method are 
as crisp and well-defined as one could hope for -- see, for example,
details for the
<a href="/watermarks/papers/detail.bigpot.html">large
pot</a> and the 
<a
href="/watermarks/papers/detail.hand.html">hand</a>.
But upon deviation from this ideal, the limits of the method reveal
themselves.  Unlike beta-radiography, the digital camera method itself
cannot mask out ink in the image capture; on heavily printed pages,
therefore, it is not an acceptable alternative to the former method.

<p>The digital images generated with this method are often comparable to
the those obtained by scanning a Dylux print.  In both cases, photo
manipulations and enhancements can be used to enhance the contrast of
the image and bring the watermark out against the text.  Although I
wasn't able to perform these enhancements as dramatically as I had
anticipated, I believe that our ability to tweak these images will
improve as photo manipulation software becomes more sophisticated and
more powerful, allowing for the editing and display of images at much
higher resolutions.  If this turns out to be the case, the digital
camera may have a slight edge over Dylux, as the camera captures true
color information that we may be better able to exploit in the future.
And because the camera's reproductions are natively digital, there is no
need for the extra scanning step that necessarily introduces the
possibility of degradation or corruption of the image.  

<p>Still, the Dylux method has some powerful advantages over the digital
camera.  Dylux is clearly the most physically adaptive of the two methods, 
as the key piece of equipment is
just a thin sheet of photosensitive paper, which can be slid far down into the
gutter of a bound book, maximizing the area of each leaf that can be
captured and hugging the contours of the page.
In contrast to the elegance of this method, the camera method
seems cumbersome.  A bound book must be propped open widely enough to allow
the photograph to be taken, a procedure that poses a threat to delicate bindings.  
The curvature of the page and the resulting shadows make it difficult to
capture the entire surface of the page, particularly in books that are
tightly bound. This limitation particularly impacts quarto and octavo
formats, in which the watermarks are often tucked deep into the binding;
in addition, the page curvature certainly has some impact on the integrity of the
reproduction relative to Dylux.  

<p>And we haven't yet considered the simple practical
advantages of the more traditional method: because Dylux paper is easily obtained, inexpensive, and highly
portable, a Dylux transfer can be made just about anywhere, quickly and
conveniently.  A $30,000 digital camera is considerably less portable;
and even those scholars lucky enough to have access to one are limited
by the need to bring the books to the equipment, rather than simply
bringing a few sheets of photosensitive paper to the reading room.
While more and more libraries are following the University of Virginia's lead in
setting up digitizing facilities exclusively for their special
collections, and it is conceivable that libraries may one day deliver
digital images of watermarks upon the request of their patrons, this is
clearly not a service we can expect any time soon.

<p>Despite all of the difficulties inherent in the method, though, 
the results of my small experiment with the digital camera were
promising enough to lead me to think about further experiments.
Hand-held high-resolution
digital cameras, alternate lighting schemes, special lens
filters for masking out ink -- I can envision a number of 
improvements that could make the direct digital capture of watermarks
more practical and improve the quality of the results.
