I reproduced every mark I found in this odd little book.  I had never before encountered either the 
serpent-like watermark or the I/O countermark.  Although the large pages and the loose binding made this 
volume easy to photograph, the poor paper quality, relative faintness of the watermarks, and heaviness of
the printing make the results somewhat difficult to analyze.  Because the book is so short, I was surprised
to find so many variations in the serpent figure (look, for example, at how differently the head is shaped
in b2, c2, and e1).  In fact, I was unable to confirm any two sheets as coming from the same mold.
