<p>As described in the methods section, these various papers provided ideal conditions
for watermark capture, as they were unbound and in most cases 
devoid of printing.  I searched on these pattern types in the Gravell watermark 
archive (see the <a href="../references.html">archives</a> section) and while I didn't find any dead-on
matches, I did find several analogues for my images, some quite striking -- see, for example,
one of the hand watermarks (ca. 1583) from the Gravell collection juxtaposed against the hand watermark
in the 
comparable watermarks for the hand, etc.</p>
